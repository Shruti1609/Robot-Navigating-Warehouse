# Robot-Navigating-Warehouse
This Python project simulates a robot navigating a warehouse using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The robot calculates the optimal path from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles. The simulation is rendered in real-time with matplotlib, showing the robot's movement and obstacle avoidance.
